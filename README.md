# Remote-Work-Mental-Health

This project investigates the impact of remote work on mental health, with a focus on factors such as working hours, work location, physical activity, and other contributing elements. As remote work becomes more common, understanding how these variables affect employees' well-being is essential for improving both productivity and mental health.


# Key Objectives:

1.) Working Hours and Mental Health: Analyze how long working hours or irregular schedules impact stress levels, burnout, and overall 
    mental health.

2.) Work Location and Mental Health: Explore how the work environment (e.g., home office, shared spaces, or non-ideal setups) affects 
    mental health, with a focus on feelings of isolation, concentration, and stress.

3.) Physical Activity: Examine the role of physical activity, or lack thereof, in remote work environments and its impact on mental 
    health, including stress reduction, anxiety, and depression.

4.) Work-Life Balance: Study how remote work influences employees' ability to separate personal life from work life, impacting mental 
    health and overall well-being.

5.) Social Interaction and Support Systems: Assess how the lack of in-person interactions with colleagues and managers affects employees' 
    mental health, compared to those with regular virtual communication and support.
